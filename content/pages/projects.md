The final project builds upon the database designed in Homeworks 8 and 9. It also utilizes many of the skills students developed in previous segments of the course. The project focuses on the building of a part of a laboratory information system. The functionality students add to the system via the project is the ability to view a patient's test results and perform rudimentary decision support using the database.
